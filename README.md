# Smart_Farming_Crop_Advisor

## *Introduction*
This dataset is part of [kaggle](https://eu.kaggle.com/) Database, posted by a user called:chitrakumari25 about Production Optimizing Algorithym. The goal of this project is to apply  statistical and machine learning algorythms in a Crops recommendation data, helping farmers to make decisions about which crops they have better conditions to grow, following climate and nutrient features.

The aim of the project was divided into 3 sections:

* *Checking Requirements of each crop* 
* *Filtering and clustering conditions to find groups of crops*
* *Build Model* Which guides us about the best productive crop as per the climatic and minerals condition, using machine learning to train our model
* 
## *File Description*
* Notebook: 
    Jupyter notebook with all data analyses, preparations and modeling tests.
* Data:
    - Crop_recommendation.csv - Contains the data that should be used on our model.
    - Smart_Farming_with_comments.csv - Contains the notebook with all the steps to create this machine learning algorythm.

## *Software and Libraries*
* This project uses Python and the following libraries:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the kaggle's user (chitrakumari25) for sharing this algorythm, showing the importance of machine learning for agriculture. [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/chitrakumari25)
