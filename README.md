# Smart_Farming_Crop_Advisor

## *Introduction*
This dataset is part of The [kaggle](https://eu.kaggle.com/) Data base, posted by a user called:chitrakumari25 about Production Optimizing Algorithym. The goal of this project is to apply  statistical skills and machine learning in a Agricultural environment helping farmers to make decisions about wich crops they have better conditions to work with following variables of climate and nutrient conditions.

The aim of the project was divided into 3 sections:

* *Checking Requirements of each crop* 
* *Filtering and clustering conditions to find groups of crops*
* *Build Model* Which grides us about the best productive crop as per the climatic and minerals condition, using machine learning to train our model
* 
## *File Description*
* Notebook: 
    Jupyter notebook with all data analyses, preparations and modeling tests.
* Data:
    - Crop_recommendation.csv - Contains the data that should be used on our model.
    - Smart_Farming_with_comments.csv - Contains the notebook with all the steps to create this machine learning algorythm.

## *Software and Libraries*
* This project uses Python and the following libraries:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Acknowledgments
